# Navigation-Challenge

**The Challenge**

Develop a one-page no-scroll marketing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that promotes a product, service, or concept of your choice.

**Specifications**
  
  ·  Build a responsive page without the use of any framework.
  
  · The page must contain a title bar, a navigation bar, and a hero banner. The page should not be scrollable.
  
  · The navigation bar should have at least four links. Add as many as you see fit to show the features of your solution. These links should not redirect to any page.
  
  · The “Home” link should be highlighted initially.
  
  · When another link is clicked, for example, “Promotions”, the Hero Banner should change into an image that describes “Promotions”. The same goes for the rest of the links. The highlighted link should change to the clicked link.
  
  · In smaller devices, the navigation bar (or links) should slide sideways to access the links not initially displayed within the viewport. See the mockup below that shows “Sportsbook” not fully shown at the page’s initial state.
  
  · The navigation bar should stop sliding to the right if the last link is already fully shown. Conversely, the navigation bar should stop sliding to the right if the “Home” link is back to its initial position.
  
  · Feel free to use any image of your choice.
  
  · (Optional but highly recommended) Host the page in any tool/service that you would prefer.
