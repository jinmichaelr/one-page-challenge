# Navigation-Challenge

**The Challenge**

Develop a one-page no-scroll marketing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that promotes a product, service, or concept of your choice.

**Specifications**
  
  ·  Build a responsive page without the use of any framework.
  
  · The page must contain a title bar, a navigation bar, and a hero banner. The page should not be scrollable.
  
  · The navigation bar should have at least four links. Add as many as you see fit to show the features of your solution. These links should not redirect to any page. Each link should have an icon to the left.
  
  · The “Home” link should be highlighted initially.
  
  · When another link is clicked, for example, “Promotions”, the Hero Banner should change into an image that describes “Promotions”. The same goes for the rest of the links. The highlighted link should change to the clicked link.
  
  · In smaller devices, arrange all links within the navigation bar in a single horizontal row. Due to limited viewport space, display the initially visible portion of the navigation bar. Allow users to swipe or slide the navigation sideways to reveal the remaining links.
  
  · Allow the user to swipe/drag the navigation to the left until the last link is fully shown. Conversely, allow the user to swipe/drag the navigation back to the right until the “Home” link returns to its original position.
  
  · Feel free to use icons and images of your choice.
  
  · (Optional but highly recommended) Host the page in any tool/service that you would prefer.
